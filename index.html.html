          You are about to complete the fitness assessment. You are presumed fit to participate based on your completion of the FSQ. You may re-accomplish the FSQ if medical concerns have developed since completion, but must do so prior to beginning the fitness assessment. If you experience injury or illness during the fitness assessment, you will have the option of being evaluated at the Military Treatment Facility, but your assessment may still count. If the medical evaluation validates your illness or injury your commander may invalidate the assessment results. If the assessment is invalidated, you will be required to reassessment within five days. At no time will a back-dated AF 469 (fitness exemption) be accepted. Each component requires minimum performance. If for any reason you do not meet the minimum requirements you are expected to complete the remaining components. Scores for all components are final.

          Muscular Strength (Push-Ups)
        </summary>
        <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-700 whitespace-pre-line">
          One-Minute Push-Up Verbal Instructions:
          The one minute push-up is an assessment of muscular strength. Place your palms or fists on the floor, hands will be slightly wider than shoulder width apart with your elbows fully extended. Your feet may be no more than 12 inches apart and should not be supported, braced or crossed. Your body should maintain a rigid head to heel form. This is the up or starting position.
          Begin by lowering your body to the ground until your upper arms are at least parallel to the floor (elbows bent at 90 degrees) then return to the up position (arms fully extended but not locked). This is one repetition.
          Your chest may touch, but not rest or bounce on the floor. If you do not come down parallel to the floor, the push-up will not count. Resting can only be done in the up position.
          You may remove your hands or feet from the floor or bridge or bow your back, but only in the up or rest position, resting any other body part on the floor is not allowed. If resting occurs in the down position, the push-up portion of assessment will be terminated and your score will be based on the correct number of push-ups performed up to that point.
          Your breathing should be as normal as possible. Make sure you do not hold your breath. You have one minute to perform as many correct push-ups as you are able. Your counter will count the correct number of push-ups aloud. Your counter will not count incorrect push-ups. Your counter will tell you what you are doing wrong and will repeat the last number of correct push-ups in one minute is recorded as your score.

          Two-Minute Hand Release Push-Up Verbal Instructions:
          The two minute hand release push-up is an assessment of muscular strength. You will begin in the prone position and must ensure your hands are flat on the ground with the index fingers inside the outer edges of the shoulders. This is the starting position.
          You will push your whole body up from the ground as a single unit to the up position by fully extending the elbows. You will maintain a generally straight body alignment from the top of the head to the ankles. This generally straight position will be maintained for the duration of the exercise.
          You will bend your elbows to lower the body back to the ground. The chest, hips and thighs should touch down at the same time. Your head or face do not have to contact the ground. Without moving your head, body, or legs, you will extend both hands out from the body until your arms are fully extended forming a 90-degree angle between your arms and trunk at the shoulders. Hands must be off the ground. After reaching this position, your elbows bend to move the hands back under your shoulder. You must ensure your hands are flat on the ground with your index fingers inside the outer edges of the shoulders and push your whole body back to the starting position. This completes one repetition.
          Resting can only be done in the up position. You may remove your hands or feet from the floor or bridge or bow your back, but only in the up or rest position, resting any other body part on the floor is not allowed. If resting occurs in the down position, the hands release push-up portion of test will be terminated and your score will be based on the correct number of hands release push-ups performed up to that point. The number of successfully completed repetitions in two minutes will be recorded as the raw score.

        <summary class="font-semibold text-blue-700">
          Core Endurance (Sit-Ups, Reverse Crunch, Forearm Plank)
        </summary>
        <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-700 whitespace-pre-line">
          One-Minute Sit-Up Verbal Instructions:
          The one minute sit-up is an assessment of core endurance. Begin by laying face up on the floor or mat. Your feet may extend off the floor or mat, but your buttocks, shoulders, and head must not extend beyond the mat. Bend your knees at 90 degrees, with your feet or heels in contact with the floor at all times. Cross your arms over your chest with your open hands or fingers at your shoulders or resting on your upper chest. This is the starting position. When conducting sit-ups, any part of the hands or fingers remain in contact with the shoulders or upper chest at all times.
          If a bolted non-portable toe hold bar is used: Anchor your feet to the ground by hooking your feet or toes under the bar. Your heels must remain in contact with the ground at all times and the bar cannot move while you perform the assessment.
          If a toe hold bar is NOT used: You may request the assessor to hold your feet with their hands or by putting their knees on your feet. The assessor may not anchor you by holding behind the calves or by standing on your feet during the assessment as they could lose balance and step off. You may request a member of the same gender to hold your feet and that request must be granted. Let your monitor know if you need your feet held differently prior to beginning the assessment. (e.g., "You are holding my ankles or feet too tight or not enough.”).
          From the starting position, raise your upper torso until your elbows touch your knees or thighs. Then, lower your upper torso until your shoulder blades contact the floor. This is one repetition. Your elbows must touch your knees or thighs at the top of the sit-up, and your shoulder blades must contact the floor or mat at the bottom of the sit-up (keeping any part of your hands or fingers in contact with your shoulder or upper chest at all times).
          The repetition will not count if your hands or fingers come completely away from the chest or shoulder or if your buttocks or heels leave the ground. Additionally, you may not grab onto your shirt as it makes it difficult to determine if you are maintaining proper contact. Any resting must be done in the up position. While resting, you may not use knees or any object to support yourself. If there is any resting other than in the up position, the sit-up portion of the assessment is terminated and your score will be based on the correct number of sit-ups performed up to that point.
          You have one minute to perform as many correct sit-ups as you are able. Your counter will count the correct number of sit-ups aloud. Your counter will not count incorrect sit-ups. Your counter will tell you what you are doing wrong and will repeat the last number of correct sit-ups until you correct the error. The total number of correct sit-ups in one minute is recorded as your score.

          Two-Minute Cross Leg Reverse Crunch Verbal Instructions:
          The two minute cross leg reverse crunch is an assessment of core endurance. You will lie on your back on a flat, level surface, legs straight, and feet on the ground. Arms are crossed over the chest with open hands or fingers touching the shoulders or upper chest. Hands can’t grab the shirt. The use of an exercise mat is optional for this exercise.
          While keeping the lower back on the floor, bring both legs toward the chest while reaching your left elbow across your body to touch your right thigh. Then return to the starting position. This is counted as repetition number one.
          While keeping the lower back on the floor, bring both legs toward the chest while reaching your right elbow across your body to touch your left thigh. Then return to the starting position. This is counted as repetition number two.
          The repetition will not count if your hands or fingers do not remain in contact with the shoulders or upper chest throughout the assessment, including the rest position. Additionally, the repetition will not count if your lower back lifts off the ground, elbow does not touch the opposite thigh, or legs do not fully extend when returning to the starting position.
          The resting position will be the same as the starting position. Note: while performing this exercise your head does not need to touch the ground. If you move out of place greater than a foot you will be warned and if it continues those repetitions will not count. Your final score is the correct repetitions completed at 2 minutes.

          Forearm Plank Verbal Instructions:
          The forearm plank is an assessment of core endurance. It will be performed on a flat, level surface. An exercise mat may be used. You must be entirely on or off the exercise mat, (i.e., upper body cannot be on the exercise mat with feet off). The event will consist of maintaining a proper forearm plank position for the maximum time allowed.
          The PTL will record time with a stopwatch to the nearest second and will announce “START”, as well as 15-second intervals.
          You will begin face down on the floor with elbows bent, forearms flat on the floor/mat, with the body in a straight line through the head, shoulders, back, buttocks and legs.
          Elbows must be aligned directly below the shoulders at a 90-degree angle between the forearm and upper arm. Hands will either be in fists with the pinky side of the hand touching the floor or lying flat with palms touching the floor. Forearms may be parallel or angled inward, but the hands cannot be clasped together.
          Feet should be placed hip-width apart. Hips must be lifted off the ground with only the forearms, hands and toes on the floor. Knees are straight, pelvis in a neutral position and back flat. The back, buttocks and legs must be straight from head to heels and must remain so throughout the assessment. The back, buttocks and legs must be straight from head to heels and must remain so throughout the test.
          Toes, forearms and fists or palms must remain in contact with the floor/mat at all times and folding of hands is not permitted. No other part of the body may contact the vertical support surface.
          Involuntary muscle spasms (e.g., shaking, trembling, or quivering) resulting from maximum exertion during the exercise is anticipated and permitted as long as the proper forearm plank position is maintained.
          Forearm plank ends when maximum time for the forearm plank has elapsed or until the last participant stops prior to the maximum time allowed, any part of the body other than hands (fists/palms) forearms, or feet touch the floor, member lowers head to hands, member lifts hands, forearms or feet off the floor, member does not maintain 90 degrees at the elbow (i.e., shifting weight forward or back on forearms/toes decreasing or increasing the 90-degree bend).
          If you receive more than two corrections on form. The third correction will stop the assessment and the time will be recorded. This will be your official forearm plank time (score).

          Cardiorespiratory (Run, HAMR, Walk)
        </summary>
        <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-700 whitespace-pre-line">
          1.5-Mile Timed Run Verbal Instructions:
          This 1.5-mile timed run is used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness. Prior to beginning the 1.5-mile run, you may complete up to a three-minute warm up. You will line up behind the starting line and will be instructed to begin running as I start the stopwatch. No physical assistance from anyone or anything is permitted. Pacing is permitted if there is no physical contact and is not a hindrance to other runners. You are required to stay on and complete the entire marked course. Leaving the course is disqualifying and terminates the assessment. Your completion time will be recorded when you cross the finish line and you are required to complete a cool down for approximately five minutes. If at any time you are feeling in poor health, you are to stop running immediately and you will be given assistance.

          20-Meter HAMR Verbal Instructions:
          The 20-meter HAMR is used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness. Prior to beginning the 20-meter HAMR, you may complete up to a three-minute warm-up.
          You will run between two lines 20 meters apart, at a progressively faster pace, to the tempo of a recorded beep.
          You will start behind the first line and begin jogging to the opposite line when instructed by the recording. You will leave the line when you hear the beep, and should arrive at the opposite line just before the next beep. You must touch the line with one foot before the beep sounds. If you get to the line early, do not begin running back before the beep sounds.
          Failure to reach the line before the beep, or leaving the line too early, will result in a warning. Three consecutive warnings will result in termination of the assessment. If you receive a warning, but successfully reach the line on the next shuttle, the warning count will start back at zero.
          You must reach the opposite line on every shuttle. If the beep sounds prior to reaching the line, you must complete the shuttle before you can turn and attempt the next shuttle. Failure to reach the opposite line will result in a warning. However, stopping before the line and returning to the opposite line will result in the termination of your assessment. Failure to attempt a shuttle (i.e. resting or skipping shuttles) will result in the termination of your assessment, as well. You must maintain cadence with the beep sequence at all times.
          After each level the time between beeps will become shorter, requiring you to run faster. You are encouraged to keep going until you are no longer able to keep the pace. If at any point you feel unable continue, you may stop the assessment and step off the court. Your score will be the last successful shuttle completed before three consecutive warnings or when you voluntarily terminate your assessment.

          2 Kilometer Walk Verbal Instructions:
          This assessment measures cardiorespiratory fitness. Prior to beginning the 2 kilometer walk, you may complete up to a three-minute warm-up. You will be directed to line up behind the starting line and instructed to begin walking as I start the stopwatch. You are to walk the 2 kilometer course as quickly as you can. You must not run, keeping at least one foot in contact with the ground at all times. No physical assistance from anyone or anything is permitted. Pacing is permitted if there is no physical contact and is not a hindrance to others.
          You are required to stay on and complete the entire marked course. Leaving the course is disqualifying and terminates the assessment. Your completion time will be recorded when you cross the finish line and you are required to complete a cool-down for approximately five minutes. If at any time you are feeling in poor health, you are to stop immediately and you will be given assistance.
